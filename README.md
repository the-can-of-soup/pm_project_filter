# PenguinMod Project Filter
[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) userscript to filter projects containing certain keywords from [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com/) front page and search results.

You may want to try [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) instead if TamperMonkey doesn't work, but the userscript is untested here, so no guarantee it will run properly.

**Userscript URL:** [`https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/pm_project_filter/raw/refs/heads/main/penguinmod_project_filter.user.js`](https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/pm_project_filter/raw/refs/heads/main/penguinmod_project_filter.user.js)
